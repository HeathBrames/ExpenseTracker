# ExpenseTracker
Track your expenses with this application built in React.js

Features:

- Add and Delete Transactions 
- Visualize your total income, expenses, and account balance

This application helped me get more experience and familiarity with Hooks, Context API, and React.js in general.

This is a beginner level project built using Traversy Media's Youtube tutorial Building an Expense Tracker in React.
